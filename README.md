# ðŸ§  curRAG â€” AI-Powered Research Assistant

> **curRAG** *(Curated Retrieval-Augmented Generation)* is an AI-driven **research assistant** designed to help you explore, summarize, and query scientific papers â€” starting with **arXiv** datasets.  
> Built in one week as a hands-on RAG system project for intelligent literature curation and contextual understanding.

## ðŸš€ Overview

curRAG enables researchers and students to:
- Retrieve the **most relevant arXiv papers** for a given query.
- Generate **context-aware summaries** using state-of-the-art **RAG pipelines**.
- Ask **natural language questions** over paper abstracts or full texts.
- Maintain a **local knowledge base** for faster retrieval.

The projectâ€™s goal is to build a **research companion** that bridges retrieval precision with LLM understanding.
